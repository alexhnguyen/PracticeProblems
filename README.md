# Practice Problems

To test and improve my abilities, I am solving readily available practice problems.

## [Project Euler](./euler)

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) are challenging problems in math and computer programming that require mathematical insight, 
and computationally efficient solutions. 

## [Cracking the Coding Interview](./cracking_coding_interview)

The [book](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com) has interview questions ranging from basic to tricky algorithm problems.
