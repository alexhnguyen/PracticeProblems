# Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) are challenging problems in math and computer programming that require mathematical insight, 
and computationally efficient solutions. 

Problems can be found [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
	
Here is my attempt at the questions.

## Requirements
```
pip install numpy
```

## Running

```
python3 main.py
```

## Sample output

```
(1) Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
Time 0.0002 secs 	 Ans: 233168

(2) By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
Time 0.0000 secs 	 Ans: 4613732

(3) What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143.
Time 0.0008 secs 	 Ans: 6857

(4) Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
Time 0.1691 secs 	 Ans: 906609

(5) What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
Time 0.0001 secs 	 Ans: 232792560
